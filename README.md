* Confirmed HTML compliant, via [validator.w3.org](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcutwell.github.io%2F1kb%2F).
* Page weight of 881 bytes, via [gtmetrix.com](https://gtmetrix.com).

1KB club websites (those listed on [https://1kb.club/](https://1kb.club/)) are generally signposts for other work by the developer. This website is no different, and serves as a simple CV and link tree. Most cosmetic options from `featherweight` have been disabled, but there was enough space for simple styling, as well as HTML compliancy (e.g.: setting the lang and viewport).
